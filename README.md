# MERN-BLOG

This is my first MERN stack blog. 
MERN means MongoDB / Express / React / Node.js, of course.

The blog is for desktop / tablet / mobile phone screen.(It is responsive project)

## Purpose of the project

Before I started the project, I set some goals.

1. I didn't want to use CSS libraries like Material UI or Tailwind CSS. Insted of using these libraries, I decided to use SASS with gulp. Because, I learned how to use SASS recently and I would like to get used to using it. 

2. I decided to create Authentication and Authorization system with JWT(jsonwebtoken). But, I thought JWT has vulnerability for security. Based on my internet research, I decided to use JWT in Http Only Cookies. And, I decided to use Access Token / Refresh Token system.

3. I wanted to create two routes. One route is for admin user. The other is for normal user.
In normal user route, user can read all blogs, comments and post a comments. 
Of course, the user delete own comments.But, normal user can not create a blog post.

In admin user route, admin user can do everything. Admin user can create new blog post, update past post, delete post, add comments, delete comments(even if the comments wrote by the other user!!)

## Feedback of the project

It took about two weeks to write code.
But, in fact, to complete the project, I had to learn many things.

I had to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript fundamentals.
I had to learn React.
I had to learn Node.js.
I had to learn Express.
I had to learn Mongoose(MongoDB).

I am a 100% self-taught programmer. And I have been studying programming about one year ago.
So, in fact, it took about one year to complete the project for me.

Most challenging part for me, to create Authentication / Authorization system with JWT.

Because I couldn't understand an advantage of JWT and why so many people want to use JWT.

It was easy for me to understand JWT's concept.
JWT is took information about users from backend and stored in frontend. 
Therefore, it is easy to use user's information for Authentication or Authorization without burdening on server(like MongoDB).

It is very simple concept. And I loved it.
But..., is it real?
The more I studied about JWT, the more unclear.

Because, even if user's information stored in JWT in the frontend, the data have to be checked whether the data is real or not, isn't it?
It means JWT have to transmit data to server, and it means burden on server after all, isn't it?

In addition, I thought (in fact I am thinking even now) that JWT has vulnerability for security.
Because JWT has been user's information in the front end, and anybody can read the information.
So, programmer have to be careful how to handle JWT, and after all, programmer have to invented very complicated method like Access Token / Refresh Token instead of just using plain JWT.(In addition, in real world application,  Access Token / Refresh Token is being used with Redis...?)

I think it is not necessary steps if I use traditional way like session and cookies.
It is more secure and easy way for me(And maybe for many programmers).

Of course, I am junior level developer.
So, it might just be that I don't have adequate skills.(And of course, I know I have to learn more)
But, at least as of today, I am thinking that JWT is not special power.
On the contrary, JWT will be cause severe security problems in the future.

(It is difficult for me to understand how to use JWT. If readers are in same conditions, please check under contents. It is very helpful for me to understand JWT.
